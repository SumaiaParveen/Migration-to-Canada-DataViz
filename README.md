# [Immigration to Canada (UN 2015 Revision Dataset) DataViz](https://github.com/SumaiaParveen/Migration-to-Canada-DataViz/blob/main/Immigration_to_Canada_DataViz.ipynb)

## ABOUT THE DATA

Quoted from [the UN](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/migrationflows.asp), the dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals. The current version presents data available from 45 countries.

This compilation of data on international migration flows is useful for analytical purposes, but also serves to raise awareness about the problems of comparability among available statistics. Countries collecting and publishing data on the flows of international migrants use different definitions to identify migrants and use different concepts to determine their origin and destination.

## What are shown in these infographics?

I have analyzed the dataset to find out which countries contributed the most and least in the immigration process. It turns out a larger portion of canadian immigrants are from China, India and Phillipines. 

## Libraries used
